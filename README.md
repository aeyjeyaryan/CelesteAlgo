Welcome! This repository documents my journey into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), using Python as my primary tool. Here you'll find a comprehensive collection of learning resources and code examples, as I progress from the fundamental building blocks of Python to advanced AI/ML concepts and techniques.

Who am I?

I'm Aryan Kumar Jha, a B.Tech CSE student with a passion for exploring the potential of AI/ML. This repository is my way of sharing my learning process, hoping to inspire and collaborate with others on this journey.

What to expect:

Step-by-step progression: The repository starts with foundational Python concepts and gradually builds upon them, introducing more complex AI/ML topics as I learn.
Clear explanations: Each resource will include code examples, explanations, and insights gained during my learning process.
Open format: Feel free to fork, clone, and contribute to this repository! Your feedback and suggestions are highly valued.
Current focus:

I'm currently focusing on mastering the core aspects of Python, with emphasis on data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. As I progress, I'll dive deeper into libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, laying the foundation for future AI/ML explorations.

Roadmap:

Python Fundamentals: Variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions, etc.
Data Structures & Algorithms: Lists, dictionaries, stacks, queues, sorting, searching, etc.
Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
Numerical Computing: NumPy & Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib for creating informative and beautiful visualizations.
Machine Learning Basics: Supervised & unsupervised learning, linear regression, classification, etc.
Deep Learning: Exploring frameworks like TensorFlow & PyTorch for neural networks.
Stay tuned!

My journey is just beginning, and I'm excited to share it with you. Check back often for new learning resources and code examples as I delve deeper into the fascinating world of AI/ML. Let's learn and grow together!
